This is a notice that the user account "<%= @user.user_name %>" needs updated subscription information. We tried to auto-resume the subscription settings you had on hand before, but for some reason it failed.

To address this problem please update your subscription settings in CoughDrop:

<%= JsonApi::Json.current_host %>/<%= @user.user_name %>/subscription

If you need help or think this message was sent in error , please let us know and we'll help get to the bottom of things. Just access our support site (https://coughdrop.zendesk.com) to make a request.

Thanks!
